# Hexapod
A hexapod robot is a robot that walks on six legs, which allows it to have greater flexibility in its movement, like being able to walk on uneven terrain.

# First Milestone
My project is building a hexapod, a robot that has 6 legs and can walk on all terrains. In order to build it, I have to first, build the individual parts of the hexapod, attach the legs, complete the wiring, and then lastly calibrate the robot. The individual parts of the hexapod include the base, the circuit board, the legs, and the battery. First, the circuit board is attached to the base, and the battery is connected to the circuit board. Lastly, each leg is attached to the base of the robot while the power is on so that the robot is calibrated properly. Each leg is made up of 3 servo motors, and 4 different acrylic parts, which I attached together using screws and disc servo arms.

So far, I have built the base and attached all of the legs to the base, while ensuring that the legs are positioned correctly when the power is on. 

The biggest struggle was that I attached all of the legs when the power was on, which caused the legs to be positioned incorrectly. Therefore, I had to disassemble the robot, connect the battery, turn on the power, and reinstall the legs.

My next steps are to clean up the wiring of the robot by reconnecting all of the servo motors to their correct ports, and by using cable tidy to arrange all of the wires of the servo motors. Finally, I have to calibrate the robot so that its default position is how I want it.

# Starter Project
My starter project was building a Simon Says Machine. To build the machine, I had to solder the LEDs, power and sound switches, battery clips, decoupling caps, a microcontroller, and an alarm. 

My main difficulty was manipulating the solder so that the shape of it looks clean and appealing. I fixed this by applying the solder first, and if I was unhappy with the shape, I manipulated the solder using the soldering iron to remelt and reshape the solder. 

The machine works by emitting a series of colors and sounds, and the user's job is to copy exactly what the machine does like the game, Simon Says. Each of the four buttons has a unique color and sound to make it easier for the user and also more accessible for everyone. The game will keep adding onto the pattern until the user messes up the pattern, at which point, the machine will make a loud beeping sound and all four of the lights will go off.

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
