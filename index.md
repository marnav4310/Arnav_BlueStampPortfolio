# Hexapod
A hexapod robot is a robot that walks on six legs, which allows it to have greater flexibility in its movement, like being able to walk on uneven terrain.

- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

# Starter Project
My starter project was building a Simon Says Machine. To build the machine, I had to solder the LEDs, power and sound switches, battery clips, decoupling caps, a microcontroller, and an alarm. 

My main difficulty was manipulating the solder so that the shape of it looks clean and appealing. I fixed this by applying the solder first, and if I was unhappy with the shape, I manipulated the solder using the soldering iron to remelt and reshape the solder. 

The machine works by emitting a series of colors and sounds, and the user's job is to copy exactly what the machine does like the game, Simon Says. Each of the four buttons has a unique color and sound to make it easier for the user and also more accessible for everyone. The game will keep adding onto the pattern until the user messes up the pattern, at which point, the machine will make a loud beeping sound and all four of the lights will go off.

Here is the website for the Simon Says machine: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10547

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
